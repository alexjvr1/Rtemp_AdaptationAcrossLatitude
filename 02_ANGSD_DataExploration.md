# ANGSD on low coverage data

Because we're using ddRAD on such large genomes, the mean coverage per individual is very low (~2x)

Here we'll use ANGSD to call genotype likelihoods across all 193 SE individuals (16 pops) and explore the data. 

## 1. Call genotype likelihoods for all 193 individuals

First we'll explore the data by calling genotype likelihoods simultaneously across all individuals using [04b_ANGSD.SE193.sh]()

```

## 2. Missingness across loci and individuals

## 3. Depth across individuals and loci

## 4. Filtering plan for different datasets
