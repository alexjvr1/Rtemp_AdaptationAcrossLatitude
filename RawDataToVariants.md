# Raw data to variants

Raw fastq data was demultiplexed, and adapters removed. See [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/427872v1) for methods

A new Rana temporaria genome was released by Sanger. We're using the first public version: aRanTem1_1.curated_primary.20200424.fa

The genome is available [here](ftp://ngs.sanger.ac.uk/scratch/project/grit/VGP/aRanTem1/) and was released to me 1 June 2020. This should be submitted to GenBank/ENA soon. 

Contact at Sanger = James Torrance.
